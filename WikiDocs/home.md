# RESTful API description
## Overview

Spending Tracker Web API is a product for people who want to take their finances to the next level. This Web API is made
for personal or business use.

It helps you to track your spending and income, so you can easily follow how your personal retirement savings account is doing 
or how much money your workplace is spending on pencils.

Users can make their own wallets with their own categories and balances. You can follow both your personal and business
account and track how different departments or your children are using their money.

Query a wallet and you get spending/savings categories linked to that specific wallet.
